# Full-Stack CAP Project Guide 🌟

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for developing a full-stack application on SAP's Business Technology Platform (BTP) using the Cloud Application Programming (CAP) model and UI5 for the frontend. This journey begins with setting up a CAP project and will culminate in integrating a UI5 Freestyle application. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites 📋

Ensure you have the following before proceeding:

- Access to [SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)](https://sap.com/btp).
- A subscription or access to [Business Application Studio (BAS)](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html).
- Basic understanding of CAP and UI5 frameworks.

## Step 1: Clone the Starter Project 🔄

1. **Access BAS**: Log into BTP and navigate to your BAS subscription. Create a new Dev Space tailored for Full-Stack Development.

2. **Clone the Project**: Open a terminal in BAS and execute the following command to clone the starter project repository:
3. `git clone https://github.com/pafliasT/btp_final_exercise.git`

This repository contains the basic structure of a CAP project.

## Project Structure 🔍

The starter project includes several key directories:

- `db/`: Where your data models (CDS entities) will reside.
- `srv/`: For service definitions that expose your data models as OData services.
- `app/`: This will host your UI5 Freestyle application, connecting the frontend with the backend.

## Your Tasks 📝

### Step 1: Design Your Data Model

1. **Navigate** to the `db/` directory.
2. **Create** a new file for your schema, e.g., `mySchema.cds`.
3. **Define** your entities within this file. Consider what data your application will manage and how these entities relate to each other.

### Step 2: Implement Services

1. **Move to** the `srv/` directory.
2. **Initiate** a new service definition file, e.g., `myService.cds`.
3. **Expose** your entities through this service, crafting the API that your frontend will consume.

### Step 3: Develop the UI5 Freestyle App

1. **Configure a new ui5 Project:** Go to the top-left burger menu and chose `File -> New Project from Template`.

     - **Application Type:** Choose `Sap Fiori Application` and click `Start`.
     - **Template Selection:** Choose `Basic` and click `Next`.
     - **Data Source and Service Selection:** Choose `Use a Local CAP Project` and choose your CAP Project's OData services.
     - **Entity Selection:** Give your View a name or stick with the default View1.
     - **Project Attributes:** Click `Finish` without configuring anything in this step.

2. **Integrate** with the backend services you've defined, making sure your app can display and manipulate the data.

## Running the Application Locally 🏃

- **Backend**: Use `cds watch` in the root directory to serve your backend services locally.
- **Frontend**: Navigate to your UI5 app directory and run it according to your setup (e.g., `ui5 serve`).

## Next Steps 🌈 

- **Expand Your Data Model**: As you develop your app, you may find the need to refine or expand your data model.
- **Enhance Services**: Consider adding more complex queries or actions to your services.
- **UI5 App Features**: Continuously improve the UI5 app with new features, better UI components, and enhanced user interaction.


## Congratulations! 🎉

You are now on your way to contributing to a full-stack SAP application using CAP for backend services and UI5 for the frontend. This guide is just the beginning. Your creativity and problem-solving skills will lead the way as you build and expand the application.

Happy coding! 🚀
